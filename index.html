                <div> <h3>1. Polar Vantage V2</h3>
                   <p>The Vantage V2, from Finnish sport tech brand Polar, is a satisfyingly lightweight and minimalist fitness tracker that takes a 360 approach to health. As well as drilling down into your running, swimming and cycling sessions, it also comes with tools that help you to identify if you’re straining yourself too hard – helping you to avoid injuries and dispiriting setbacks. You’ll also get full access to the brand’s data-driven program, Polar Flow, which keeps track of all of your training stats. That’s not to mention the 40 hours of battery life, advanced wrist-based heart monitor, mindfulness tools and more.<br>Polar Vantage V2, £449</p>

                <div> <h3>2. Leica M10-R Digital Rangefinder Camera</h3>
                   <p>Look, it isn’t cheap. That much is obvious. But we’ve had a little look at your Instagram profile (it doesn’t matter how), and we’re sorry to say that it’s going to need some serious investment – sadly, a black and white iPhone filter does not a good picture make. With the Leica M10-R, you’ll be getting a beautiful and brilliant camera from one of the most seasoned manufacturers in the game. Compact and incredibly easy to use, with an impressive 40-megapixel sensor, it’s the perfect base from which to delve into the often tricky and confusing world of photography.<br>M10-R Digital Rangefinder Camera, £7100</p>

                <div> <h3>3. Steamery Cirrus No. 2 Travel Steamer</h3>
                   <p>Ironing boards are for schmucks. Well, maybe that’s unfair – but they’re definitely for people who Can Be Bothered. If you are not one of those people, but also need to keep up appearances on Zoom, then we suggest you invest in a lightweight portable steamer. It'll easily remove creases from clothes and help to get rid of odours, too. One of the most important considerations when buying one is the water tank capacity (you don’t want to pop to the sink for a refill every 30 seconds), and this Cirrus No. 2 model from Steamery runs for six minutes at a time. Not only that, but it comes with a detachable brush for more delicate fabrics like silk and wool, and a stainless-steel plate.<br>Steamery Cirrus No. 2 Travel Steamer, £110</p>

                <div> <h3>4. Pixel 5 5G</h3>
                   <p>So you want to jump aboard the good ship 5G, but don’t know which phone you should opt for? Google’s Pixel range is one of our favourites, and the newest model is impressively affordable. That doesn’t mean it’s skimped on power or features, however: the camera software is better than ever, and the Snapdragon 765G chipset combines with 8GB of RAM for a seamless experience. As ever, the design of the model and the operating system are extremely clean and smooth, and it can easily be used in one hand (more than you can say for most flagship phones.) Another win.<br>Polar Vantage V2, £449</p>

                <div> <h3>5. Bose Smart Sound Bar 300</h3>
                   <p>Listen, you deserve a top tier sound bar. You just do! It makes the TV experience so much more immersive, even if you exclusively watch Come Dine With Me re-runs (scratch that; especially if you exclusively watch Come Dine With Me re-runs.) The sleek Bose Smart Sound Bar 300 is one of our favourites: it boasts four full-range drivers, a central dome tweeter and two ports, and is built-in with Google Assistant, and Alexa with Voice4Video tech (the last one allows you to control your TV by voice, too). Top stuff.<br>Bose Smart Sound Bar 300, £399.99, johnlewis.com</p>

                <div> <h3>7. Focal for Bentley Radiance Headphones</h3>
                   <p>Focal and Bentley have teamed up again to create these: a pair of refined high-fidelity headphones inspired by design elements of the EXP 100 GT concept car. There are the copper accents, and the diamond lattice pattern, as well as the earcups crafted in soft Pittards gloving leather. Engineered, developed and crafted in France, you’d struggle to find headphones that make quite as much of a statement. (That statement being, ‘I have really, really nice headphones’)<br>Focal for Bentley Radiance Headphones, £1199, bentleymotors.com</p>

                   <p>Tablets have come a long way, and it doesn’t get much sleeker or more powerful than the Surface Pro X. Whatever line of work you’re in, Microsoft’s machine can make things easier for you – and it goes without saying that it makes keeping in touch over Zoom a lot more satisfying (it’s essentially all-screen).<br>Microsoft Surface Pro, £999, microsoft.com</p>

                <div> <h3>9. Bose QuietComfort Earbuds</h3>
                   <p>The most impressive True Wireless device we’ve tried in a long time. Sitting comfortably and securely in the ear through exercise sessions, these sweat-and-water-resistant earbuds boast brilliant noise-cancelling technology which you can toggle with using the Bose app. The sound quality is top tier, too, and the battery life is solid: six hours from a single charge, and the wireless charging case provides two extra charges, amounting to 18 hours in total. Not exactly cheap, but they’re one of the best options on the market.<br>Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, £249, johnlewis.com</p>

                <div> <h3>10. Chipolo One Bluetooth Key Finder</h3>
                   <p>In the immortal words of Mr. Zip: Have you ever been in this situation where you lost your keys and your         mobile phone? Where me keys? Where me phone? Where me keys? Where me phone?<br>
                       Of course you have! Too many times. But worry not, because we have just the thing to help you. The Chipolo, made from recycled fishing nets, emits a 120db loud sound that help you find your keys, phones and other valuables. What’s more, the battery life lasts up to two years and is easily replaceable. An affordably priced device that could come in very, very handy.<br>Chipol One Bluetooth Key Finder, £26, amazon.co.uk</p>
